# PopJs - Population Dynamics Modeling

PopJS is a javascript engine to develop
 population dynamics models purely in the
front-end.

Population dynamics models use calculus in
 simple differential equations to model a wide variety
 of population behavior, from explosive growth,
  equilibrium, cycles and catastrophic collapse.

Source code <https://github.com/boscoh/popjs>

Built on Vue, Vuetify and RK45.js for integration.
